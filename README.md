## Course Deliverable

    • Exam code: "J"
    • Due Thursday, December 12, 2024, 9:00am

## Course Description

An exploration of four communication competencies: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Students develop engaging voices as speakers and writers through study of concepts such as purpose, occasion, audience, and genre. The use of reading and listening to interpret ideas of others and form one's own will be applied toward thesis-driven written and spoken texts. The topical material covered in the seminar varies from section to section and year to year. All first-year students take Introduction to Communication Competencies in either their first or second semester. Must be taken on the letter-grade basis.

+ Distribution Requirements: None
+ Credits 4

## Topic Description

Students investigate the dynamics of digital information, its origins, sources, and its social, political and cultural impact. The discourse serves to familiarize students with the diverse technological frameworks, origins of data, algorithms, and the processes in play that create information. Emphasis is placed on the quality of information in terms of bias, factual content, diffusion, and the ethics of its usage. The use of reading and listening to interpret ideas of others and form one’s own ideas will be applied toward thesis-driven written and spoken texts.
Offered below are the main objectives of the course with a brief description.

+ Function (and malfunctions) of using data: We discuss how information gained from complete or incomplete data may result in outcomes that may or may not be desirable.
+ Ethics of data usage: Students are shown common faults that occur during the collection, analysis, and usage of data in research and media.
+ Reading and writing data in research: Students gain skill in proper communication and use of data in a research setting. During this section, the course will describe the mishandling of data in areas such as p-value tampering, obfuscation of detail, misrepresentation and misinformation.
+ Reading and writing data in media: Students focus on proper communication of data from the popular media. During this section, the course will describe common abuses of data to misinform.

## Learning Outcomes

+ To craft effectively organized messages for specific purposes, occasions, and audiences.
+ To develop genre-appropriate strategies for revising and reorganizing based on feedback received.
+ To engage in reading and listening as acts of critical thinking.
+ To summarize, analyze, and create thesis-driven oral and written texts.

## Other Outcomes

Students who complete the Speaking and Writing Seminar (SWS) sequence will be able:

+ To demonstrate, as readers, writers, speakers, and listeners, an awareness of audience, purpose, occasion, and genre conventions and their effects on the creation and delivery of ideas.
+ To use the ideas of others to advance thinking.
+ To use iterative composing processes to discover and reconsider ideas and their expression.
+ To engage in reading, writing, speaking, and listening as acts of critical thinking

## Textbooks

All required reading will be given in class.

|:------------|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|
|A| 96 - 100    |A-| 90 - 95.9 |
|B+| 87 - 89.9  |B|  83 - 86.9 |B-| 80 - 82.9 |

## Categories

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following categories. All percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so presents itself, it is possible for the assigned percentages to change during the academic semester.

| Category | Percentage | Assessment metric|
|:---- | :----- | :----- |
| Class Activities | 20% | check mark grade|
| Writings | 30.00% | letter grade|
| Presentations | 30.00% | letter grade |
| Final Project | 20% |letter grade
| Total | 100% | |

### Definitions of Grading Categories

- Class Activities: All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. Your participation will take forms of completing in-class exercises that involve reflections on the required readings and videos, conducting peer-interviews, engaging in constructive discussions in class, and experimenting with various technologies online. Unless other information is given about due dates, activities are to be completed by the end of class.
- Writings: Students will be reading articles and materials given in class to prepare essays on assigned subjects. These assignments enable students to gain skills in communicating points of view or conceptual ideas. For each assignment, there will clear expectations listed about the boundaries and scope of the assigned writing assignment. In addition, there is a due date, and an expiration date which must be respected as we will be having peer-editing sessions where class members pair together to discuss writing samples.
- Presentations: Students will be given many speaking opportunities during the class. Giving talks to peers in class is an enriching experience that offers numerous benefits for both the speaker and the audience. For the speaker, crafting a short and effective talk requires careful planning and organization of ideas. This process helps the speaker develop clarity in their thoughts and refine their communication skills, ensuring that they can convey complex concepts succinctly and persuasively. Furthermore, creating a compelling set of slides to accompany the presentation enhances visual storytelling abilities and encourages creativity in design and data representation. Additionally, delivering the talk in front of listeners provides valuable feedback, enabling the speaker to improve their delivery and address any questions or misconceptions on the spot. Overall, giving talks in class not only bolsters public speaking and presentation skills but also fosters critical thinking, effective communication, and collaboration among peers.
- Final Project: This speaking and writing project will present you with an opportunity to design and implement a written and oral work where your thesis follows some ethical violation, and negative impacts of improper data usage. For example, essays could follow themes of usage including; transparency & liability, miscommunication /misinformation, bias in Artificial Intelligence due to improperly or partially trained models, and similar types of topics.

## Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the class sessions. If you will not be able to attend a session, then please see/email the course instructor at least one week in advance to describe your situation. Students who miss more than five (5) unexcused classes meetings will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. Students who miss more than ten (10) of the aforementioned events will automatically fail the course.

## Receiving Grades

Your grades will be communicated to you by a Canvas

## Submission of Assignments via Canvas

In our class, you are required to submit all assignments through Canvas, which is the platform utilized by your instructor for collecting and managing student work. To ensure a smooth submission process, please familiarize yourself with using this software efficiently. Should you encounter any difficulties, kindly consult your peers or approach your instructor for assistance. It is essential that you confirm the receipt of your submissions to prevent any potential loss of credit due to the instructor's inability to locate your work.

_Please refrain from emailing your assignments directly to your instructor._

## Assignment Submission Policies

All class assignments will be accompanied by a _stated due date_ and a _late submission deadline_ (the latest date for submitting an assignment, which is one week after the original due date). Unless there of other instructions concerning submissions, students are expected to submit the electronic versions of assignments by the start of class on specified due dates. Late submissions will be accepted up until one week past the stated due date but will incur a 15% penalty. All late submissions must be made at the beginning of the session scheduled one week after the original due date.

_Assignments will not be accepted beyond one week past the assigned due date._

## Requesting Extensions

Unless otherwise arranged with your instructor, _no extensions will be granted for lab assignments_ after the late submission deadline. Students seeking extensions for lab submissions must email their request along with a valid reason for their extension before the assignment's original due date. The decision to grant an extension is made considering fairness towards peers who are still able to meet deadlines, regardless of individual schedules.

## Handling Extenuating Circumstances

Should you encounter exceptional circumstances that hinder your preparation and completion of class assignments, please reach out to me as soon as possible to discuss alternative arrangements. It is essential that you do not wait until the last day of class to request exceptions, as stated in this syllabus. In case of unforeseen difficulties, you may also seek assistance from campus resources:

- [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
- [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)

## Allegheny College Policy and Awareness Statements

### Statement of Community

Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms.

### Academic Integrity

Allegheny College has a student-run Honor Code designed to promote individual responsibility and integrity in academic affairs. Each student pledges the following: “I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.” Your professor will educate you about the meaning of academic integrity in this course, which may be different in some respects from other courses in which you are enrolled. Please ask the professor if you have questions. Please see [academic honor program's website](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/academic-honor-program/) for more details.

### Midterm Grades

Midterm grades will be submitted for all students in this course by Wednesday, October 16, but will not appear on academic transcripts. By giving you an early indication of your performance so far, midterm grades offer an opportunity to make adjustments, if necessary, before the end of the term. While midterm grades are primarily focused on first and second-year students, upper-level students may also receive them in some courses. This feedback is a key part of our commitment to supporting your academic journey.

#### Academic Alerts (prepared by MCSS)

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

#### Mental Health and Wellness (prepared by Wellness in Student Life)

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

Keep in mind, course deadlines, absences, and accommodations for mental health are subject to the course policies and expectations that are set within this syllabus. Students are encouraged to communicate with their professors as soon as possible regarding their needs and seek support if their mental health impacts their academic performance or daily life. When you find yourself struggling emotionally, remember that there are supports available, and you are not alone.

Students who are in need of mental health support can access multiple resources to receive support.  The 98.6 CampusCare app provides physical and behavioral health consultation and supports free of charge 24/7 via telehealth for any actively enrolled student who downloads and signs up with their smartphone.  Allegheny College has also partnered with ECPS (Edinboro Counseling and Psychological Services) to provide in-person therapy on campus. The ECPS partnership with Allegheny College delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student community through brief individual counseling, and crisis support.

Students may request services from ECPS by calling (814) 332-4368 or by emailing the Wellness Case Manager at `wellness@allegheny.edu`.

#### Gator Success Grants

The [Gator Success Grant](https://sites.allegheny.edu/gator-success-grants/) program is designed to provide students with additional financial assistance to offset the total cost of college attendance and to encourage successful on-time degree completion. Currently enrolled students who have an unanticipated need are invited to apply. Grants are usually from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the request and the student's need. Please direct questions to `studentsuccess@allegheny.edu`.

#### Writing and Speaking Consultants (prepared by the Directors of Writing and Speaking)

Experienced peer writing and speaking consultants in the Maytum Center for Student Success help writers and speakers make academically responsible choices and determine strategies for effective communication at any stage in the writing or speaking process, for assignments in any discipline, or for writing and speaking situations unrelated to coursework (e.g., personal statements, cover letters, interviews, conference presentations). Both appointments and drop-in sessions are available.

These all-college programming days  feature programs and workshops that highlight educational opportunities at Allegheny, that prepare students for life after graduation, and that help to create a greater sense of campus community.

#### Class Deans (prepared by MCSS)

The [Office of Class Deans](https://sites.allegheny.edu/maytum-center-student-success/class-deans/) in Pelletier Library serves as a place for students to begin seeking assistance and answers to their questions related to college life. If you have a question and don’t know who to ask – ask a class dean. If you want advice – talk to a class dean. Aacha Gregg is the First Year Class Dean, Amy Stearns is the Second Year Class Dean / Director of Transfer Advising, and Carene Shipley is the Third/Fourth Year Class Dean. Dom Turner is the Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, located in Schultz Hall. Please contact them individually or through `studentsuccess@allegheny.edu`.

#### Recording Policy (prepared by Campus Life and Community Standards Committee)

In remote teaching and learning contexts, there is an understanding that instructors (including faculty, coaches, staff, and facilitators) have the right to record class and discussion proceedings.  All other participants must request permission of the instructor in advance before making any additional recordings.  An instructor's pre-recorded material, including lectures and class notes, may not be shared with anyone outside of the course's current enrollment without the consent of the instructor. Similarly, under no circumstances may a recording, still, screenshot, picture, or any other media of any sort be altered or circulated by anyone outside of its original intent. No content may be distributed outside the circle of participants without the consent of all who appear or are heard. The college community is reminded of Allegheny College's Recording Policy, outlined in 9.8 of the Faculty Handbook, as well as Allegheny's Statement of Community. Violations will be referred to the Student Conduct system.  Classes may also be recorded if approved as an educational accommodation through the Student Accessibility and Support Services. Faculty are further reminded that recordings of class activities are educational records protected under FERPA. While students do not have a right to be anonymous in a class in which they are enrolled, they have the legal right to be anonymous to third parties. Please direct questions about FERPA to the Registrar.

#### Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Reporting (prepared by the Title IX Coordinator)

Allegheny College is committed to providing a workplace and educational environment that is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct. The College expressly prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, religion, and disability. Allegheny College prohibits sex-based harassment, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking regardless of the gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation of the individuals involved in any education program or activity that it operates, as required by Title IX, including admission and employment.

Allegheny College adheres to all federal, state, and local civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and education. The College does not discriminate in its admissions practices, in its employment practices, or in its educational programs or activities. Allegheny College also prohibits retaliation against any person participating in good faith in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the institution; for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment or for assisting someone with such a complaint.

Allegheny College is required to respond promptly and effectively, utilizing a fair, transparent, and reliable process, when they have knowledge of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in its program, and must take steps to prevent the recurrence of discrimination and remedy its effects, the college must communicate their policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their programs and must monitor and address barriers to reporting instances of sex discrimination.

Allegheny College employees must notify their Title IX Coordinator when they have information that may reasonably rise to the level of sex discrimination, so long as the employee is not a confidential employee, as defined on page 3 of this policy. All employees must be trained upon hiring and annually thereafter on (i) the College’s obligation to address sex discrimination, (ii) the scope of conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, and (iii) all duties of employees upon receipt of a report of sex discrimination, including to provide the reporting individual with contact information for the Title IX Coordinator and information about how to report sex discrimination under Title IX.

You can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. The College respects your right to file or not file a formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator must take action only in situations that pose a serious threat of harm to you or the community.

_Notice that Faculty are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations:_

Unless specifically identified otherwise by policy, all faculty, staff, and administrators of Allegheny College are considered mandated reporters and are required to notify the College’s Title IX Coordinator of any incident of discrimination and harassment disclosed to them, or known to them, involving a member of the campus community. Mandated reporting helps to ensure that individuals who are experiencing or have experienced discrimination or harassment are connected to the full range of resources and options afforded to them.

If you are in need of support or advocacy and wish to discuss such matters confidentially, you are invited to consult any of the resources listed below.
